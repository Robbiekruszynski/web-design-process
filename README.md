#### Target User 1
* Nathan - visual artist
* Needs - natural light / personal creative space
* Motivation - cost / access 24/7 / gallery showings in space
* Pain points - lack of work sink at other options / no available space to showcase.
* Tech - viewing / sign up for xj-16 primarily on mobile
#### Story
My name is Nathan and I've been a professional painter for about 5 years. I focus on larger canvas work with abstract expressionism as my focus. Oil is my main medium, which requires ventilation and a cleaning space / sink. In the past I feel the spaces I've worked out of have had some of the requirements I need but have always lacked crucial elements.  Having access to my space 24/7 is very important due to my unknown schedule, along with having the ability to showcase work within the building.

#### Target User 2
* Kate - interior designer (commercial work space)
* Needs - large workspace / natural light / work-boards
* Motivation - surrounded by creative minds for inspiration / personal space to build outside of the work environment
* Pain points - competition does not offer 3-d printer / lack of proper space for ideal workflow / slow and or unreliable internet
* Tech - internet / 3-d printer / fax / printer
#### Story
My name is Kate and I've been in commercial interior design for about 10 years. The study of ascetic and minimalist interior design has been my focus and having a space that resonates with my focus provides a positive space for my mind to create. Being surrounded by other creative minds allows for natural influence which I thrive off of. Due to templates for buildout having space for texture layouts and a 3-d printer to create demos for clients is of upmost importance. Considering my free-lance work / style having a private space to meet with clients / have conference calls promotes my personal brand and professional.

#### Target User 3
* Chris - UX designer
* Needs - common area and welcoming workspace that doesn't feel like an office
* Motivation - fast internet / available monitors to use / great selection of consumables
* Pain points - slow internet / buildout at other offerings felt too much like a typical workspace
* Tech - wifi / external monitors
#### Story
My name is Chris and I've been a UX designer for about six months, and a recent graduate from a coding bootcamp. What I quickly discovered in my internship so I don't seem to do well in an office like setting. Having an open space will allow me to not feel such "restrictions" and provide a healthier environment for me to build in. My career completely revolves around access to reliable internet and I often find places throttle speeds. Having a space that provides monitors to use / rent help give space to create, seeing as bringing personal equipment is clunky and hazardous.

## Research
#### Central office
https://centrloffice.com/
* Consistent color scheme
* Easy to navigate
* Plenty of high quality photos to showcase space
* Smart layout with great readability / "fun" but professional fonts
* Great usage of CSS grid system
* Great inspiration for personal buildout
#### NedSapce
http://www.nedspace.com/
* Basic layout, not exciting
* Little to no photos to view space
* Jarring colors with basic form / information
* Lack of detail and creative outlet creates for a sub par experience
* A good representation of what not to gain inspiration from

#### weWork
https://www.wework.com/
* Welcome page feels a bit busy
* Information presented in an accessible manner
* footer feels clunky
* map on right side with location selection is a nice touch (size needs work)
* Not very friendly in terms of color
* While overall they offer the most, their website jams too much in a small space

####Inspiration

* Easy to find amenities and billing
* Make sure splash page is attractive and doesn't overwhelm the user
* Responsive on mobile with no overflow
* Usage of flex box with spacing or css grid helps store information in an accessable way
* Color scheme to go along with interior layout will provide consistency physical to digital
* Usage of interesting / readable font helps keep interest in provided information
* Avoid "hard" layout / overload of information in a small space
