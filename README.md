#### _{Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}_

#### By _**Robbie Kruszynski**_

## Description

* _Web buildout for XJ-16 space. Showcasing a welcoming / productive shared workspace for anyone interested. Target demographic ranges "artists, day-traders, craftspeople, writers, counselors, more traditional business people--you know, anyone and everyone--in our space."_

#### Target User 1
* Nathan - visual artist
* Needs - natural light / personal creative space
* Motivation - cost / access 24/7 / gallery showings in space
* Pain points - lack of work sink at other options / no available space to showcase.
* Tech - viewing / sign up for xj-16 primarily on mobile
#### Story
My name is Nathan and I've been a professional painter for about 5 years. I focus on larger canvas work with abstract expressionism as my focus. Oil is my main medium, which requires ventilation and a cleaning space / sink. In the past I feel the spaces I've worked out of have had some of the requirements I need but have always lacked crucial elements.  Having access to my space 24/7 is very important due to my unknown schedule, along with having the ability to showcase work within the building.

#### Target User 2
* Kate - interior designer (commercial work space)
* Needs - large workspace / natural light / work-boards
* Motivation - surrounded by creative minds for inspiration / personal space to build outside of the work environment
* Pain points - competition does not offer 3-d printer / lack of proper space for ideal workflow / slow and or unreliable internet
* Tech - internet / 3-d printer / fax / printer
#### Story
My name is Kate and I've been in commercial interior design for about 10 years. The study of ascetic and minimalist interior design has been my focus and having a space that resonates with my focus provides a positive space for my mind to create. Being surrounded by other creative minds allows for natural influence which I thrive off of. Due to templates for buildout having space for texture layouts and a 3-d printer to create demos for clients is of upmost importance. Considering my free-lance work / style having a private space to meet with clients / have conference calls promotes my personal brand and professional.

#### Target User 3
* Chris - UX designer
* Needs - common area and welcoming workspace that doesn't feel like an office
* Motivation - fast internet / available monitors to use / great selection of consumables
* Pain points - slow internet / buildout at other offerings felt too much like a typical workspace
* Tech - wifi / external monitors
#### Story
My name is Chris and I've been a UX designer for about six months, and a recent graduate from a coding bootcamp. What I quickly discovered in my internship so I don't seem to do well in an office like setting. Having an open space will allow me to not feel such "restrictions" and provide a healthier environment for me to build in. My career completely revolves around access to reliable internet and I often find places throttle speeds. Having a space that provides monitors to use / rent help give space to create, seeing as bringing personal equipment is clunky and hazardous.

####Photos of Paper Sketches
We highly recommend you snap quick photos of your paper sketches, and include them in your README. This depicts your process, and you will be required to include them for larger projects and Friday independent projects.

####Screenshots of Sketch Wireframes
This is really important! Include images of the user interfaces your project includes here in the README. (This includes any mobile or tablet versions.) Oftentimes potential employers don't have time to clone and launch projects. Make it easy for them to see the amazing work you've done. You're working so hard here at Epicodus; so make that work evident. Don't hesitate to show it off.

#### List of Technologies Resources

* List all technologies and outside resources your project uses. Especially when we begin using outside UI frameworks in week three! Not only does this give credit where credit is due, but it shows employers what tools you're experienced in.

* Sketch v50.2


#### Setup Instructions
Similar to what we've done in previous courses, describe the steps necessary to launch this project in Sketch.

#### Description of Responsiveness
After we begin creating responsive sites in week 3, you should also include a description of how this site is responsive. Does it include both mobile and desktop versions? Mobile, desktop and tablet? List that information here.
